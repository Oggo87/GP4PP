# Usage

All main settings are contained in `GP4PP.ini` and everything is designed to revert back to default GP4 behaviour, including if `GP4PP.ini` itself missing. The `GP4PP.ini` file that is included with the release is also pre-configured to mimic GP4's default behaviour.

`GP4PP.ini` is divided in 4 logical sections:

* [General Settings](General-Settings.md)
* [Visor Settings](Visor-Settings.md)
* [Pitcrew Settings](Pitcrew-Settings.md)
* [Assets Settings](Assets-Settings.md)
