# GP4++

A DLL to enhance and extend Grand Prix 4 functionality.

## Description

This DLL, formerly known as *Individual Meshes And Textures*, expands original Grand Prix 4 to allow full control of how meshes (front/rear wheels, helmets, cockpits, cars, collision meshes) and textures (cockpits, helmets) are loaded, supporting per-driver, per-team, and per-track custom loading. It includes features to manage LODs (Level of Detail), auto-naming conventions, and fallbacks to default GP4 assets when custom assets are unavailable.

Additionally, it includes and expands on features originally found in [*High Resolution Pitcrews for Grand Prix 4* (`HiResPitcrew.dll`)](https://github.com/Oggo87/HiResPitcrew), both overcoming the limitation of 400 vertices in the original game, allowing high resolution pitcrew meshes to be used, and introducing support for per-team pitcrew meshes.

It also includes options to fully control cockpit and helmet visor colours and transparency, and enable the use of GP4's built-in visor shader in the cockpit mesh.

Other features include:
* Fixing the reversed tyre tread bug when using 3D rims
* Disabling the built-in check for an optical drive
